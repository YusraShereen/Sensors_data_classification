# **SENSORS DATA CLASSIFICATION**

## Using multiple CNNs to classify sensor's data

## **Project Overview**


The project aims to classify temperature, humidity, and moisture sensor data using multiple CNN models. To achieve this, wavelet transformations of sensor images have been used to train the models. The CNN models are known for their ability to recognize patterns in data and classify them accurately. The project uses this property of CNNs to classify the sensor data. By doing so, it becomes easier to monitor and analyze the sensor data. The project focuses on using multiple models to obtain the best possible classification results. Each model is trained and tested separately, and their performance is evaluated. By doing this, the best model can be selected for classification, which can lead to better accuracy and efficiency.
